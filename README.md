FACE EXPRESSIONS Detection
They have difficulty in recognizing peopleâ€™s face expressions and giving 
expressions. Therefore, they are unable to interact in society through non-verbal 
communication. The system will maintain a dynamic source of picture and after applying 
image processing techniques it will generate the models to classify them into different 
moods. Moreover, research will be performed to define a mood for detecting autism in 
patients. There will also be criteria set to get information about extent to which the 
expression recognition skills have been developed in the users.
